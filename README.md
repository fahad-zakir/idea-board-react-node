# idea-board-react-node (General Assembly Tutorial)
## Idea Board
Today we are going to be taking advantage of the data persistance of an API and the single page polish that React brings!  Our app is an idea tracker where a user can write out different ideas and save them to a database.  Kinda like leaving post-it notes in the browser!

This app will have 2 models- Users and Ideas (which will live inside of users)

Here's a GIF representation of the how this may look, though we will also add the ability for a user to 'log in'
